# SafeStack CANON

This repository defines the canonical integrity anchors for the SafeStack ecosystem.

It represents the root of trust for systems, nodes, and architectures operating under the SafeStack philosophy.
The contents of this repository are published for **verification purposes only**.

## Purpose

SafeStack CANON exists to provide:
- a verifiable reference for trusted system states
- cryptographic integrity anchors
- a clear boundary between trusted and untrusted modifications

Any change to canonical artifacts **invalidates the canon** unless explicitly re-established.

## Contents

- `CANON_HASHES.md`  
  Canonical hashes defining trusted artifacts and system states.

- `CANON_HASHES.md.asc`  
  Cryptographic signature of the canonical hashes.

- `canon_verify.md`  
  Verification principles and validation process.

- `safe_stack_architecture_map_v2.md`  
  Canonical architecture boundaries and trust separation.

- `safe_stack_mvs_minimal_viable_system.md`  
  Minimal Viable System definition for SafeStack nodes.

- `Federuota_autonominiu_mazgu_sistema.md`  
  Conceptual and philosophical foundation of federated autonomous nodes.

## Trust Model

This repository is intentionally minimal.

- It is **public** to allow independent verification.
- It is **not intended for modification or extension**.
- It does not accept feature requests or enhancements.

Trust is established through verification, not authority.

## Notes

If a system works only by following documentation, it is not understood yet.

Breaking systems is part of the learning process —  
but breaking the canon means leaving the system.

## Status

Canonical.  
Changes are exceptional and intentional.
